# 🚀 VS Code MCP Testing Guide

## ✅ **Your Configuration is Ready!**

I've added HTTP gateway endpoints to your `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

## 🔧 **How to Test in VS Code:**

### 1. **Restart VS Code**
- Close and reopen VS Code to load the new MCP configuration
- VS Code will automatically discover the new HTTP endpoints

### 2. **Test These Working Endpoints First:**
- **`context7-http`** - Documentation lookup (2 tools)
- **`supabase-http`** - Database management (19 tools)

### 3. **What You'll See in VS Code:**
```
MCP Servers:
├── context7-http ✅ (Working)
├── supabase-http ✅ (Working)  
├── browser-agent-http ⚠️ (Needs config)
├── neo4j-*-http ⚠️ (Needs credentials)
└── sequential-thinking-http ⚠️ (Needs Docker)
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting:**

### If HTTP endpoints don't connect:
```bash
# Check if sandbox is running
cd sandbox && docker-compose ps

# Start if needed
docker-compose up -d

# Test endpoint manually
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### If stdio endpoints cause issues:
- The HTTP endpoints (`*-http`) are isolated and safer
- You can disable stdio endpoints by commenting them out
- HTTP endpoints run in containers, so they won't affect your host system

## 🎯 **Benefits of HTTP Endpoints:**
- ✅ **Sandboxed**: Run in isolated containers
- ✅ **Safe**: No direct system access
- ✅ **Reliable**: Proper error handling
- ✅ **Monitored**: Health checks and logging

## 📊 **Next Steps:**
1. Try the `context7-http` server first (library documentation)
2. Test `supabase-http` for database operations
3. Configure environment variables for other services as needed

Happy MCP testing! 🎉
