## 🔧 Post-Setup Tasks
After creating the repository and pushing:

1. **Set up branch protection** (recommended):
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Restrict pushes to main branch

2. **Add collaborators** as needed

3. **Configure repository settings**:
   - Enable Issues if desired
   - Configure Actions if needed for CI/CD

The code is ready to push once the repository is created on GitHub! 🎉
