# ✅ Custom MCP Development Environment - SUCCESS!

## 🎉 Setup Complete

Your custom MCP development environment is now fully operational with the simplified routing architecture you requested.

## 📋 What's Working

### ✅ **Gateway Integration**
- **hello-world** service is registered directly as `mcp/hello-world` (not `mcp/dev/hello-world`)
- All custom services register as top-level routes: `mcp/{service-name}`
- No special dev prefixes needed

### ✅ **Dynamic Service Discovery**
- Services auto-register with the gateway when started
- No need to modify Docker Compose for new services
- Clean `mcp/**/*` routing pattern as requested

### ✅ **VS Code Configuration**
```json
{
  "hello-world-http": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp/hello-world"
  }
}
```

### ✅ **Working Tools**
- **greet**: Personalized greetings with style options
- **echo**: Message echoing with formatting
- **get_time**: Current time in various formats

## 🧪 Verified Tests

All tests passing:

```bash
# ✅ Gateway shows hello-world registered
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq '.services'
# Returns: [..., "hello-world"]

# ✅ Tools accessible
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp/hello-world \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"tools/list"}'

# ✅ Greet tool working
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp/hello-world \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"2","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"greet","arguments":{"name":"Developer","style":"enthusiastic"}}}'
# Returns: "HELLO Developer!!! 🎉 SO GREAT TO SEE YOU! 🚀"
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

```
VS Code MCP Config
       ↓
http://localhost:8080/mcp/hello-world
       ↓
MCP Gateway (auto-discovery)
       ↓
dev-mcp-service:3100 (hello-world)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **For VS Code Usage:**
1. **Restart VS Code** to load the new MCP configuration
2. The `hello-world-http` service will be available in the MCP panel
3. You can now use the greet, echo, and get_time tools

### **For Adding New Services:**
1. Create new directory: `sandbox/custom-mcps/my-new-service/`
2. Add `package.json` and `index.js`
3. Restart dev-mcp-service: `docker-compose restart dev-mcp-service`
4. Service auto-registers as `mcp/my-new-service`
5. Add to `.vscode/mcp.json` and restart VS Code

## 🔧 Development Workflow

Your requested architecture is now implemented:

- ✅ **Routes**: `mcp/**/*` pattern (no dev prefix)
- ✅ **Discovery**: Automatic service registration
- ✅ **Clean URLs**: Direct service names as routes
- ✅ **VS Code Ready**: Standard HTTP MCP configuration

The 404 error you experienced is now resolved - the hello-world service is accessible at `http://localhost:8080/mcp/hello-world` and ready for VS Code integration!
